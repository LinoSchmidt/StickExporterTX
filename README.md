# StickExporterTX

StickExporterTX is a 3D Stick Exporter for EdgeTX/OpenTX logs.

## Quick Start Guide

To log your sticks on each model, go to `settings -> global functions` in your RC controller.

![global-functions](readme/pictures/global-functions.bmp)

There you can select and edit one of the empty fields.
With `Switch` you select the one that should activate logging. For example, you can set your drone's arm switch to log it as long as the drone is armed.
`Func` must be set to `SD Logs` and `Value` should be as low as possible to get a smoother animation.

If you only want to set up logging for one model, go to `model -> special functions` in your RC controller and repeat the previous step.
